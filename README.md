UCR Music Player(Mobile App)
In this project, you will develop a lite version of Amazon Music. It should include a 
server component and a mobile app. The app should be able to scan and play songs in 
the phone storage. And users can search and purchase songs online. The player 
should record what users have listened and give user daily recommended list according 
to listening history. User can rate and write comments to songs they listen.

Milestone 0:

1. Users are able to log in their account or create new account. To sign up an account, a username and password is needed. Users must log in an account to purchase a song or give feedback to a song.

2. The player is able to scan all mp3 files in user’s device and list all of the songs in “my library” or “in device”.

3. The music player should support albums, artists and playlist. Users can create and name a playlist. Users can add songs to a playlist or remove songs from playlist. There should also be some auto playlist including: recently played, recently downloaded, recently added to device.

4. When playing music, users can choose to shuffle play, play all in the list or play single song.

5. Users can browse by genres or search songs, albums in the music store. They can choose to purchase a single song or an album. After purchase, users will be able to rate or write review to the songs or albums they purchase.

Milestone 1:

1. Users are able to see rates and comments from other users of a song or a album

2. Users can buy monthly subscription and listen to unlimited songs. But users cannot download the songs and will not have access to the songs any more after subscription is ended.

3. Listening history of users should be recorded. According to user’s preference, the player can give user daily recommended list of songs. You can use any reasonable algorithm to give the list. For example, if user listens to pop music most, recommend more pop music songs.

4. Before purchasing a song, user can listen to a free sample of the song. The sample can be a small part of the song.

5. The player should record how many times a song has been purchased or played. Then users will be able to see a weekly best seller list or ‘what’s hot’ list.
